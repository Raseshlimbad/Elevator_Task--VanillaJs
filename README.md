**Task 4: Elevator Task with Vanilla Js**

**Objective**: Build an elevator system with vanilla JS.


**Requirements:**
● Technology: Vanilla JS
● Duration: 3 days
● Demo link: https://elevator-exercise.vercel.app/


**Features:**
1. Base:
     The building has 10 floors (including the ground floor) and elevators.
     Each floor has a green button to call an elevator.
2. Calling an Elevator:
     When the "call" button is pressed, change the button to red and update the text to "waiting."
     Identify the closest available elevator to the floor and send it to that floor.
○ _Note_:
   There is a chance all elevators may be occupied at the moment.
   Ensure that no calls are missed (queue the calls if necessary).


    The elevator should move smoothly toward the selected floor.
    Measure the time it takes the elevator to reach the designated floor.
    Change the elevator's color to red while it's in transit.
3. Elevator Reaches the Floor:
    Play a sound when the elevator reaches the floor.
    Change the elevator's color to green once it arrives at the floor.
    Wait for 2 seconds before responding to the next call (if any).
    Change the button text to "arrived" and update its design accordingly.
    After the 2-second wait, change the elevator's color back to black and reset the button text to "call," restoring the initial design.

   
**Guidelines:**
  Each component should handle its specific task (UI or logic).
  Ensure components like forms or lists can be reused if necessary.
  Simple, clear, and easy-to-use interface.
  Clean and well-commented code
**Best Of Luck !**
